### Hi there 👋

I am an enthusiastic student of Business Information Technology at Red River College in Winnipeg, Canada. My passion for technology ignited long before my early encounters with the i386, and I have been captivated by its endless possibilities ever since. Seeking to expand my knowledge beyond practical experiences, I made the exciting decision to enroll in a comprehensive course that delves into essential technical areas. This course covers a wide range of subjects, including application development, database management, network administration, and web development. By immersing myself in these areas, I am determined to cultivate a solid foundation and pave the way for a successful career in the dynamic field of Information Technology.
